### Project Overview: Design of Video Streaming Server

As a software engineer, I designed and developed a **video streaming server** that uses **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS protocols** to stream video content. This project was developed in **C and C++** on an **embedded Linux platform** to ensure efficient and reliable delivery of video streams across different devices and networks.

### 1. **Purpose of the Video Streaming Server**:
   - The server is responsible for streaming video content using two widely used adaptive streaming protocols: **MPEG-DASH** (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) and **HLS** (HTTP Live Streaming).
   - It ensures smooth and adaptable streaming, allowing video playback to adjust according to the user's network conditions and device capabilities.

### 2. **Key Features and Functionalities**:
   - **MPEG-DASH and HLS Support**:
     - The server provides video streams using **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS**, enabling adaptive bitrate streaming. The server can serve video content in multiple qualities, allowing clients to switch between streams based on their bandwidth.
   - **Content Segmentation**:
     - The video content is segmented into smaller chunks (usually 2-10 seconds long), allowing the client to fetch and buffer the content progressively.
   - **Dynamic Bitrate Adaptation**:
     - Both **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS** protocols allow adaptive streaming. The server supports multiple bitrates for each video, allowing the client to switch between different qualities based on network performance.
   - **Efficient File Serving**:
     - The server delivers video segments and manifests (for MPEG-DASH) or playlists (for HLS) using standard **HTTP** protocols.
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**:
     - The server can monitor the current state of streaming sessions, including bitrate adaptation, user locations, and potential issues such as buffering or latency.

### 3. **How the Software Functions**:
   - **Content Preparation**:
     - The video content is prepared by encoding it into multiple bitrates. The content is then segmented into small chunks and stored on the server.
   - **Manifest and Playlist Generation**:
     - For **MPEG-DASH**, the server generates a **MPD (Media Presentation Description)** manifest, which describes the available streams and bitrates.
     - For **HLS**, the server generates **M3U8 playlists**, which list the available video segments for each quality.
   - **HTTP-Based Streaming**:
     - The server uses the **HTTP protocol** to deliver video segments to clients. Clients request segments progressively, allowing them to buffer and adapt in real-time.
   - **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**:
     - Based on the client’s network conditions, the server allows the client to switch between different **bitrates** seamlessly. For instance, if the bandwidth decreases, the client can request a lower-quality stream.
   - **Real-Time Segment Delivery**:
     - The server ensures low-latency, real-time delivery of video segments to clients, ensuring smooth playback even in fluctuating network conditions.
   - **Caching and Scalability**:
     - The server implements caching mechanisms to store frequently requested video segments, reducing the load and improving performance for high-traffic scenarios.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - The server includes mechanisms to handle interruptions in the stream, client disconnections, and requests for unavailable content, ensuring that video playback can resume without significant issues.

### 4. **Technologies Used**:
   - **C and C++**:
     - The core streaming functionalities were developed using **C and C++**, ensuring optimal performance and low-level control over the video content delivery.
   - **MPEG-DASH and HLS**:
     - Implemented support for both **MPEG-DASH** (ISO/IEC 23009) and **HLS** (HTTP Live Streaming by Apple), allowing the server to handle a wide range of client devices and network conditions.
   - **Embedded Linux**:
     - Developed on an **embedded Linux platform**, leveraging its network stack for efficient HTTP-based content delivery and segmentation handling.
   - **HTTP Protocol**:
     - The server uses **HTTP** for serving video content, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of video players and devices.
   - **Segmentation Algorithms**:
     - Algorithms were developed to split video content into smaller, manageable segments for adaptive streaming.
   - **Bitrate Adaptation Logic**:
     - Integrated **adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR)** logic to dynamically adjust the video quality based on real-time feedback from clients.

      - Designed a scalable architecture for the video streaming server, ensuring it could handle multiple concurrent clients and deliver streams efficiently.
      - Defined interaction patterns between the server and clients for both **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS**.
   3. **Content Preparation Module**:
      - Developed tools to encode video content into different bitrates and segment it appropriately for **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS**.
      - Created utilities to generate manifest files for DASH and playlists for HLS.
   4. **Core Streaming Server Development**:
      - Implemented the core server in **C and C++** to handle HTTP requests from clients, deliver video segments, and ensure smooth adaptive streaming.
      - Wrote efficient routines to handle segmented video delivery while maintaining minimal latency.
   5. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Implementation**:
      - Developed algorithms to enable **adaptive bitrate switching**, ensuring clients could switch streams dynamically based on network conditions.
      - Integrated both **MPEG-DASH** and **HLS** specifications into the server for adaptive streaming.
   6. **Testing and Optimization**:
      - Performed thorough testing with various video players and network conditions to ensure seamless playback.
      - Optimized the server’s handling of large numbers of concurrent connections to ensure scalability.
   7. **Real-Time Monitoring Tools**:
      - Integrated monitoring tools to log and observe video delivery quality, bitrate adjustments, and client-side issues in real time.
   8. **Deployment and Integration**:
      - Deployed the streaming server on an **embedded Linux platform** and tested its performance under different scenarios (high traffic, variable networks).
