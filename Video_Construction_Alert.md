### Project Overview: Construction Zone Detection and Notification System

Designed and developed a **construction zone detection system** using the car's dash-cam feed, which analyzes the video in real time to identify construction zones. Once detected, the system sends the car’s current location to a central server, which then alerts nearby cars to avoid the route. The system was built in **C++** on an **embedded Linux platform** and utilized **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks.

### 1. **Purpose of the System**:
   - The system processes the **dash-cam video feed** to detect **construction zones** ahead of the vehicle.
   - When a construction zone is detected, it captures the vehicle's **current location** using GPS.
   - The location is sent to a **central server**, which alerts nearby cars to avoid the potentially congested or blocked route, enhancing overall traffic flow and road safety.

### 2. **Key Features and Functionalities**:
   - **Real-Time Construction Zone Detection**:
     - The system leverages **OpenCV** to process the video stream from the dash-cam in real time, identifying common features of a construction zone (e.g., barriers, signs, and workers).
   - **GPS Location Tracking**:
     - Upon detection of a construction zone, the car’s current **GPS coordinates** are fetched to pinpoint the exact location of the zone.
   - **Server Communication**:
     - The system sends the detected **location data** to a remote server via network protocols.
   - **Proximity-Based Notifications**:
     - The server identifies nearby cars based on their location and sends them notifications to **avoid the route** with the detected construction zone.
   - **Efficient Video Processing**:
     - By using **OpenCV** for object detection, the system ensures fast and efficient analysis of the video stream without overloading the system’s resources.

### 3. **How the Software Functions**:
   - **Dash-Cam Video Processing**:
     - The software continuously captures video frames from the dash-cam.
     - These frames are processed using **OpenCV** to identify visual cues of construction zones, such as traffic cones, signs, and workers wearing reflective clothing.
   - **Construction Zone Detection Algorithm**:
     - The algorithm, developed using **OpenCV**, employs **object detection** and **pattern recognition** to accurately detect construction zones, minimizing false positives.
   - **Location Acquisition**:
     - Upon successful detection, the system retrieves the **current GPS coordinates** of the vehicle through a GPS module integrated with the car’s system.
   - **Data Transmission to Server**:
     - The software sends the vehicle’s **location data** to a central server using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTP or MQTT) over the embedded network stack.
   - **Notification System**:
     - The server receives the data, checks for nearby vehicles using their last known locations, and sends notifications to cars within a certain radius of the construction zone, advising them to take alternate routes.
   - **Handling Multiple Detection Events**:
     - The system is designed to handle continuous detections and send only relevant updates, ensuring that multiple notifications are not sent for the same zone unless a significant time lapse occurs or location changes.

### 4. **Technologies Used**:
   - **C++**:
     - The core logic of video processing, detection, and communication was implemented using **C++** for optimal performance and control over low-level system resources.
   - **OpenCV**:
     - Utilized **OpenCV**, an open-source computer vision library, to perform real-time image processing and object detection in video frames to identify construction zones.
   - **Embedded Linux**:
     - Developed the entire system on an **embedded Linux platform**, leveraging its robust networking and hardware interface capabilities for real-time video processing and communication.
   - **GPS Module**:
     - Integrated with the car’s **GPS module** to fetch accurate location data whenever a construction zone is detected.
   - **Server Communication**:
     - Used standard communication protocols like **HTTP** or **MQTT** to send data to the server securely and efficiently.
   - **Proximity Alerts**:
     - The server utilizes the GPS coordinates of other nearby vehicles and sends alerts when they approach the detected construction zone.
