### 1. **Overview of the App**:
   - **Purpose**: The software service builds a detailed representation of the autonomous vehicle’s surroundings using input from various sensors (LiDAR, camera, GPS, and more), extracts landmarks from the environment, and compares these landmarks with already known locations to update the vehicle’s map in real time.
   - **Functionality**: The service uses sensor data to identify objects, structures, and landmarks, compare them with an existing database of known landmarks, and update the map if new or previously unknown landmarks are detected.

### 2. **Key Features**:
   - **Real-time Environment Construction**: The application constructs a 3D model of the car’s environment based on sensor input (LiDAR, camera, GPS, etc.).
   - **Landmark Extraction**: Extracts key landmarks like buildings, road signs, trees, or other distinctive objects from the sensor data.
   - **Landmark Comparison**: Compares detected landmarks with a pre-existing map or database of known landmarks to determine the vehicle’s location relative to them.
   - **Map Update**: Automatically updates the map with any new landmarks or changes to the environment.
   - **UI Display**: Provides a real-time visual representation of the constructed environment and landmark data through a user interface.

### 3. **Functionality and Flow**:
   - **Sensor Data Input**: The application receives data from the autonomous vehicle’s sensors, such as:
     - **LiDAR**: Captures 3D point clouds of the surroundings.
     - **Camera**: Provides video or image data to help with landmark identification and classification.
     - **GPS/IMU**: Supplies geolocation data and vehicle orientation.
     - **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Offers proximity and distance readings for nearby objects.
   - **Environment Reconstruction**:
     - **LiDAR Processing**: The point clouds are used to reconstruct a 3D map of the immediate surroundings, identifying objects based on shape and size.
     - **Image Processing**: Camera data is processed to extract features and identify landmarks visually.
     - **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate representation of the environment (e.g., combining LiDAR’s 3D point cloud with camera images for better object identification).
   - **Landmark Extraction**:
     - **Feature Detection**: Extracts prominent objects such as buildings, signs, trees, or road markers from the sensor data using algorithms like RANSAC, edge detection, or feature matching.
     - **Object Classification**: Uses machine learning or pattern recognition techniques to classify detected objects as landmarks.
   - **Landmark Comparison**:
     - **Database Lookup**: Matches detected landmarks with a pre-existing map or database of known landmarks.
     - **Location Estimation**: Estimates the vehicle’s location based on landmark positions and compares it with GPS data for accuracy.
   - **Map Update**:
     - **New Landmark Detection**: Identifies landmarks that are not in the existing database and adds them as new entries.
     - **Map Maintenance**: Updates the map with new landmarks or modifies existing ones if their positions have changed.
   - **Real-time Visualization**:
     - **UI Components**: Provides a live view of the reconstructed environment, highlighting known landmarks and newly found objects.
     - **Map Display**: Shows the current map with updated landmarks.
     - **User Interaction**: Allows the user to toggle between different views (3D environment, map view, etc.) and manually review the detected landmarks if necessary.

### 4. **Technologies Used**:
   - **C++**: The application’s core logic, sensor data processing, and map updating algorithms are developed in C++ for efficiency and real-time performance.
   - **Qt 5 Framework**: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time visualization of the environment and landmarks.
     - **Qt Widgets**: Implemented for various UI components like buttons, windows, and view toggles.
     - **Qt OpenGL/Qt 3D**: Used to render the 3D environment reconstructed from LiDAR and other sensor data.
     - **QtMultimedia**: Handles image and video processing for camera input.
   - **OpenCV**: Utilized for image processing, object detection, and feature extraction from the camera input.
   - **PCL (Point Cloud Library)**: Employed for processing and analyzing the LiDAR point cloud data, including 3D reconstruction and object recognition.
   - **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Integrated to handle sensor communication, data gathering, and streaming from different sensors.
   - **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Used for real-time environment mapping and landmark detection, with algorithms like EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) or Particle Filter.
   - **Machine Learning**: Trained models for object classification and landmark recognition from camera and LiDAR data (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch for object detection).
   - **Multithreading**: Leveraged Qt’s multithreading capabilities to manage sensor input, data processing, and UI updates in parallel.

### 5. **Development Process**:
   - **Requirements Analysis**: Gathered requirements based on the need for real-time environment construction and landmark-based localization.
   - **Architecture Design**: Designed the system to handle multiple sensor inputs simultaneously and integrate map updating features.
