Connectivity Manager  [C, C++, AOSP, AIDL, Embedded Linux, IP-Networking ] [Github-link](https://github.com/VivekChugh/profille/blob/main/project_Networking_CM.md)
- **Optimized network configuration performance** by reducing the time taken to set up IP rules, VLANs, and routing tables, improving initialization speed by [X]% (if measurable).  
- **Enhanced modularity and maintainability** by refactoring the codebase, introducing better abstraction layers for handling multiple network interfaces, making it easier to extend and debug. 
- **Improved security compliance** by integrating dynamic firewall rule management using iptables/nftables, strengthening protection against unauthorized network access.  
- **Streamlined development processes** by mentoring junior engineers, improving code review practices, and introducing best practices for C++ and Linux networking development.  
- **Strengthened fault tolerance and failover handling** by implementing automated network state monitoring and adaptive route reconfiguration in case of link failures.  
- **Refined technical documentation and knowledge sharing**, ensuring clearer architecture diagrams, configuration guides, and troubleshooting steps for seamless handover and maintenance.  

MQTT-Based ECU Communication System [C, C++, MQTT, AOSP, Embedded Linux] [Github-Link](https://github.com/VivekChugh/profille/blob/main/project_MQTT.md)
- **Optimized MQTT Broker Performance**: Enhanced the Mosquitto MQTT broker configuration on the Gateway ECU, resulting in improved message throughput and reduced latency in inter-ECU communications.
- **Developed Robust Client Libraries**: Created efficient and lightweight MQTT client libraries for various ECUs, facilitating seamless publish/subscribe interactions and ensuring reliable message delivery across the system.
- **Implemented Advanced Topic Management**: Designed a structured topic hierarchy and implemented access control mechanisms, ensuring secure and organized message routing between applications on different ECUs.
- **Enhanced System Scalability**: Refined the system architecture to support the addition of new ECUs and applications without significant reconfiguration, promoting scalability and ease of integration.
- **Improved Fault Tolerance**: Integrated mechanisms for detecting and handling communication failures, ensuring system resilience and maintaining reliable operation under adverse conditions


**Sr Engineer** | Nov 2016 - Jul 2018 | Faraday Future, Los Angeles 

Over-The-Air (OTA) Enabled Bootloader [C, Memory mapping, ISR] [Github-Link](https://github.com/VivekChugh/profille/blob/main/project_OTA_BL.md)
- **Enhanced Security Protocols**: Implemented advanced cryptographic checks, including SHA-256 hash verification and digital signature validation, to ensure the integrity and authenticity of firmware updates, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized code execution.
- **Developed Fail-Safe Rollback Mechanism**: Designed and integrated a robust rollback feature that automatically reverts to the previous firmware version in case of update failures or corruption, preventing device bricking and ensuring continuous operation.
- **Optimized Partition Management**: Improved the bootloader's partition management system to efficiently handle multiple firmware slots, facilitating seamless transitions between current and updated firmware versions during OTA updates.
- **Reduced Bootloader Footprint**: Refactored low-level C code to minimize the bootloader's memory usage, achieving a more compact and efficient implementation suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems.
- **Streamlined OTA Update Process**: Enhanced the OTA update mechanism to support more reliable and faster firmware downloads over various wireless communication interfaces, improving the user experience and reducing downtime during updates.
- **Improved Documentation and Developer Support**: Created comprehensive documentation detailing the bootloader's architecture, update procedures, and troubleshooting guidelines, aiding future development and facilitating easier maintenance.



**Sr Tech Developer - Tech Lead** Jun 2015 - Oct 2016

*Verizon \| Dallas*

- Video QoS benchmarking system for 4k content (C++11 , Embedded Linux,
  MPEG DASH, HLS)

- System extracts different parameters from streaming video frames.
  Then, use them to benchmark video QoS.

- Proposed a much more effective benchmarking system when I found that
  some other available parameters are more reliable indicators of QoS
  then the ones which are being used currently.

- Designed the system around above-mentioned proposal which reduced
  false positives and false negatives significantly around 70% combined
  reduction .

- Led a team implementing the feature. Conducted Code reviews to uphold
  the code quality.

- Design of Video Streaming server (C++11 , Linux, MPEG DASH, HLS, RTMP)

- Server provide full-fledged HTML5 interface to client for content
  browsing and selection.

- Created unified architecture for streaming of on demand media and IPTV
  channel feeds.

- Implemented core module Video Streaming Server that uses HLS/MPEG-DASH
  protocol for audio-video data transport.

- Received accolades from project\'s stake holders for taking initiative
  and contributing valuably not only to my own module but also to other
  modules that were interacting with it.

**Sr Engineer, Grade 8 - Tech Lead** May 2014 - May 2015

*Continental Automotives \| Singapore*
