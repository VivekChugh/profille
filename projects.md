## Work Experience

**Staff Engineer SG-8** Sep 2018 - Present
*Ford Motors \| Waterloo*

Connectivity Manager  [C++, AOSP, AIDL, Linux, IP-Networking ] [Github-link](www.google.com) 
- **Optimized network configuration performance** by reducing the time taken to set up IP rules, VLANs, and routing tables, improving initialization speed by [X]% (if measurable).  
- **Enhanced modularity and maintainability** by refactoring the codebase, introducing better abstraction layers for handling multiple network interfaces, making it easier to extend and debug. 
- **Improved security compliance** by integrating dynamic firewall rule management using iptables/nftables, strengthening protection against unauthorized network access.  
- **Streamlined development processes** by mentoring junior engineers, improving code review practices, and introducing best practices for C++ and Linux networking development.  
- **Strengthened fault tolerance and failover handling** by implementing automated network state monitoring and adaptive route reconfiguration in case of link failures.  
- **Refined technical documentation and knowledge sharing**, ensuring clearer architecture diagrams, configuration guides, and troubleshooting steps for seamless handover and maintenance.  

**Sr Engineer** Nov 2016 - Jul 2018

*Faraday Future \| Los Angeles*

- Sensor Visualization and streaming Framework (Linux, C++, Embedded
  Linux, SRT)

- Designed and developed framework to stream sensor frames (Lidar Point
  cloud) on a 3D rendering in real time.

- Framework had to be versatile enough to stream different sensors data
  (with different formats) .

- Supports Lidar, Camera, Occupancy grid frames to be visualized on
  browser and stream over SRT protocol. Easily extendible to frames
  produced by other sensors.

- Although started as debugging tool for perception algorithms, quickly
  extended to include use cases where user should be able to visualize
  sensor data on dashboard screen. OTA enabled Bootloader for Autonomous
  Driving Module C, TCP/IP, Embedded sys, DoIP, UDS

- Bootloader initializes hardware then it downloads application as DoIP
  payload and jumps to application.

- Managed relationship with supply partners on delivery of hardware/chip
  specific drivers and submodules.

- Developed Doip-UDS server application (as part of bootloader) to
  download and flash payload to ECU.

**Sr Tech Developer - Tech Lead** Jun 2015 - Oct 2016

*Verizon \| Dallas*

- Video QoS benchmarking system for 4k content (C++11 , Embedded Linux,
  MPEG DASH, HLS)

- System extracts different parameters from streaming video frames.
  Then, use them to benchmark video QoS.

- Proposed a much more effective benchmarking system when I found that
  some other available parameters are more reliable indicators of QoS
  then the ones which are being used currently.

- Designed the system around above-mentioned proposal which reduced
  false positives and false negatives significantly around 70% combined
  reduction .

- Led a team implementing the feature. Conducted Code reviews to uphold
  the code quality.

- Design of Video Streaming server (C++11 , Linux, MPEG DASH, HLS, RTMP)

- Server provide full-fledged HTML5 interface to client for content
  browsing and selection.

- Created unified architecture for streaming of on demand media and IPTV
  channel feeds.

- Implemented core module Video Streaming Server that uses HLS/MPEG-DASH
  protocol for audio-video data transport.

- Received accolades from project\'s stake holders for taking initiative
  and contributing valuably not only to my own module but also to other
  modules that were interacting with it.

**Sr Engineer, Grade 8 - Tech Lead** May 2014 - May 2015

*Continental Automotives \| Singapore*

Played key role in development of telematics products for French and
German OEMs. Initially sourced from comtel solutions on one-year
contract, was offered permanent role in .

- Computer vision FW for Construction zone Notification C, Qt/QML,
  Computer Vision, Embedded sys

- Developed recognizer of construction signs using dashcam video feed.

- Designed communication module which sends message to server to update
  traffic data with newly found Construction zone

**Sr Software Engineer** Aug 2005 - Apr 2014

*Samsung Labs \| New Delhi*

- IPTV app for SmartTV C, RTSP, RTP, H.264, JS, Embedded Linux, RTMP

- Won the best project award for making IPTV App for Samsung DTV
  platform.

- Increased the server performance 60% by properly implementing
  multithreading.

- Designed the Probe module for which essentially included probing
  different SNMP properties of IPTV remotely.

- In-Hotel Video Streaming server C, Linux, RTSP, RTP, MPEG2-TS

- Implemented and coded Video Streaming Server framework that Adheres to
  RTSP protocol for client interaction and easily extendable to other
  protocols of same category.

- Coded for RTP protocol to support to MPEG2-TS stream data over Linux
  UDP sockets.

- Implemented fault tolerance feature for slave nodes in cluster.
