### Overview: Connectivity Manager (CM)
**Connectivity Manager (CM)** module, designed to handle network setup and management for an embedded Linux platform based ECUs. This module is responsible for creating a secure, efficient, and isolated networking environment for applications by managing IP rules, IP routes, routing tables, and VLANs (Virtual LANs). Below is a pointwise explanation of what the CM module does, how it functions, and the technologies used to develop it.

### 1. **Purpose of the Connectivity Manager (CM) Module**:
   - The **Connectivity Manager (CM)** is responsible for setting up and managing the **networking stack** on an embedded Linux platform.
   - It allows applications to utilize network resources while ensuring **security**, **traffic isolation**, and **efficiency**.
   - It dynamically manages:
     - **IP rules and routes**: to control packet flow.
     - **Routing tables**: to manage traffic across different interfaces.
     - **VLANs**: for traffic segmentation and isolation.
   - CM abstracts complex network setup tasks, so applications can focus on their core functionality without dealing with low-level network configurations.

### 2. **Key Features and Functionalities**:
   - **IP Rules Management**:
     - CM sets up **IP rules** to define how network packets are routed based on source or destination IP addresses, interfaces, or other criteria.
     - This helps control traffic flow and define special policies for different network interfaces (e.g., prioritizing traffic on specific links).
   - **IP Routes and Routing Tables**:
     - It dynamically configures **routing tables** based on network topology and routing policies.
     - CM ensures the right routing decisions are made to send traffic over the most optimal path by maintaining multiple routing tables for different traffic classes (e.g., main route, default route).
   - **VLAN Setup**:
     - CM creates and manages **VLANs** for different network segments, ensuring traffic isolation between different virtual networks.
     - This is essential for secure and segmented communication, particularly when handling sensitive data or segregating networks with different priorities.
   - **Security Integration**:
     - The module ensures the network setup adheres to security policies by integrating **firewall rules** and **encryption policies** where needed.
     - It can restrict traffic from untrusted interfaces or block communication between certain VLANs unless explicitly allowed.
   - **Traffic Prioritization and QoS**:
     - CM is capable of setting up **Quality of Service (QoS)** policies, allowing prioritization of critical traffic over less important data streams.

### 3. **How CM Functions**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - CM initializes at system boot or when an application requests networking resources.
     - It identifies available network interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.) and checks for existing configurations.
   - **Dynamic Network Configuration**:
     - Based on system policies or application requests, CM sets up **IP addresses**, **routing tables**, and **VLANs**.
     - For example, it might allocate IP routes for external internet traffic through one interface while isolating internal traffic on another VLAN.
   - **Policy-Based Routing**:
     - It uses **policy-based routing (PBR)** to define which packets should follow which routes based on specific conditions (e.g., source IP, interface).
   - **Monitoring and Adaptation**:
     - CM continuously monitors the network state and adapts configurations if changes occur (e.g., an interface goes down or a new route becomes available).
     - It can reroute traffic dynamically, ensuring robustness in the event of failure.
   - **Security Checks**:
     - CM integrates with Linux’s **iptables** or **nftables** for firewall rules, ensuring traffic adheres to predefined security rules.

### 4. **Technologies Used**:
   - **C++**:
     - CM was developed using **C++** to leverage its performance and memory management features, crucial for embedded systems.
     - The object-oriented nature of C++ allowed for modular design, making it easier to extend CM to support new network features or security policies.
   - **Embedded Linux**:
     - CM runs on an **embedded Linux platform**, leveraging Linux’s built-in networking tools such as `ip`, `iptables`, and `ifconfig` to handle low-level network configurations.
     - Embedded Linux provides a lightweight, customizable environment suitable for resource-constrained systems, ideal for CM’s requirements.
   - **Netlink Sockets**:
     - **Netlink sockets** were used to communicate with the Linux kernel’s networking stack, allowing CM to modify IP rules, routes, and VLAN configurations programmatically.
   - **VLANs**:
     - **802.1Q VLAN tagging** was employed to isolate traffic and create virtual network segments on a shared physical network.
   - **iptables / nftables**:
     - **iptables** or **nftables** were used for managing firewall rules and packet filtering, ensuring that the network was secure against unauthorized traffic.
   - **Policy-Based Routing**:
     - CM utilized **policy-based routing** (PBR) to create advanced routing policies based on multiple factors, such as packet origin, destination, and network interface.
   - **Bash Scripting**:
     - Some parts of the configuration (such as initializing networking interfaces or bringing up VLANs) involved calling **Bash scripts** within the embedded Linux environment.

### 5. **Steps Taken to Develop the CM Module**:
   1. **Requirement Analysis**:
      - Identified network requirements for traffic isolation, security, and route management for the embedded platform.
   2. **Design**:
      - Designed the architecture of CM with a focus on modularity and ease of configuration. Created UML diagrams to map out how IP rules, routes, and VLANs would be set up.
   3. **Network Interface Abstraction**:
      - Developed an abstraction layer for handling multiple network interfaces (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.), enabling the CM to manage network configurations independent of specific interface types.
   4. **Development**:
      - Implemented the core functionality in **C++**, making use of Linux’s networking APIs (e.g., netlink) to set up routes, tables, and VLANs dynamically.
      - Integrated **error handling** and **logging mechanisms** to ensure that any issues in network setup (e.g., interface down, IP conflict) were detected and reported promptly.
   5. **Security Integration**:
      - Worked with security teams to ensure that firewall rules were integrated into the CM configuration, allowing dynamic changes without compromising security.
   6. **Testing and Validation**:
      - Tested CM across various scenarios, including different network topologies, route failovers, VLAN isolation, and traffic prioritization.
      - Performed extensive testing using tools like **ping**, **netcat**, and **iperf** to ensure network performance and security were maintained under various loads.
   7. **Optimization**:
      - Optimized the module for performance, ensuring that it could quickly set up and modify network configurations in real-time.
   8. **Documentation**:
      - Documented the entire CM system, including configuration files, API usage, and troubleshooting steps for network administrators.
